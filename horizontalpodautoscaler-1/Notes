^^ The version of k8s already has the rotate-server-certs thing in its
   kubelet.yaml.

Add this to clusterapi's workload.yaml, in TalosControlPlane:

```
       - op: add
         path: /machine/kubelet/extraConfig
         value:
           serverTLSBootstrap: true
```

See that serverTLSBootstrap landed in kubelet config:

  $ talosctl -n $vip --talosconfig talosconfig cat /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.yaml

  You'll also see rotateCertificates in that config.

Approve the certificate so talos can complete all of its bootup steps:

  kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig get csr
  kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig certificate approve <cert>

Then apply the kubelet-serving-cert-approver, and then metrics-server, as
shown in talos doc above.

  ^^ That is never run when added to extraManifests as shown in talos doc.
     Maybe it's a proxy thing in CF lab?
     Anyway, works if you do the steps manually.

Try something: see if that cert-approver will approve the cert that was
causing talos to not complete its boot steps.

Then try the workload generator from the kubernetes.io doc above.

kubectl port-forward service/php-apache 8001:80
